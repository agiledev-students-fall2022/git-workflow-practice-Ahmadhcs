# Why did I find it interesting
I stumbled across this article regarding the newest trend that has surfaced in the music world. What caught my eye was the fact that it combined two of my current passions which is computer science and music. A lot of people seem to be using AI in order to generate album covers. In my 20 years of living on this earth, I did not imagine we'd reach this milestone just yet. Whilst this may seem not so hard or insane, but having computers "imagine" complex images is a huge step in the right direction. What brought this trend to the surface was the creators who allowed their computers to browse through pictures to generate the rest of already existing album covers. Fans were able to view the "completion" of the album covers they've had on their shelves for years which is just so surreal!
